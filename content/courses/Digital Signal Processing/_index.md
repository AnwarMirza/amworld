summary: Welcome to the course website of Digital Signal Processing. In this course, we aim at introducing the basic concepts and tools that are necessary to process digital signals. The course is intended particularly for the students of computer engineering, electrical engineering, computer science and systems engineering (but of course others can also benefit from it). The course is designed for one semester at undergraduate level. It may also be used for introductory purposes at first semester graduate level.

## Course Description

The following topics are covered in this course:

- History and overview
- Sampling theorem and aliasing
- Sampled signals, periodic signals, non-periodic signals
- Impulse response and convolution
- Digital spectra analysis
- Discrete Fourier transform
- Fast Fourier transform
- Z-transform
- Digital filters, FIR and IIR filter design
- Windowing
- Effect of finite word length in digital signal processors
- Application in audio and image processing.

## Course Study Outcomes
At the end of the execution of this course, the student will be able to demonstrate the following:

- Identify some reasons for studying digital signal processing.
- Contrast the meanings of analog and digital signals.
- Describe the sampling theorem and the spectra of a periodic signal.
- Determine the spectrum of a signal using the DFT and the FFT, and explain the - - difference between the DFT and the FFT.
- Perform discrete convolution.
- Describe a system using differential equation and apply z-transform.
- Design digital filters that have specified frequency characteristics.
- Analyze frequency selective filters in the z-transform domain.
- Apply windowing on a signal and explain how it improves transform properties.
- Be able to design, analyze, and implement digital filters in Matlab.
- Explain how digital techniques cancel noise in audio processing.
- Explain how low-pass filtering tends to smooth out images.

## Prerequisites

- Good **programming skills** in `MATLAB` or `python` - be able to write reasonably large programs.
- Knowledge of basic `calculus` and `differential equations`.
- Some familiarity with `probability and statistics`.

## Course Material

The following books are recommended for general reading:
